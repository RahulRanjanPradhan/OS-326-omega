                            ALARM CLOCK
                            ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

**** thread.h ****
Added to struct thread:
  struct semaphore sema;              /* Semaphore used to lock this thread
                                           when sleep */
  int64_t wakeup_time;                /* Time that this thread should
                                            wake up. */
  struct list_elem sleep_list_elem;   /* Element in sleep_list. */

**** timer.c ****
Add a static member:
    /* List of processes in sleeping state, that is, processes
       should be be blocked until the wakeup_time of the processes. */
    static struct list sleep_list;

---- ALGORITHMS ----

Use semaphore to implement new thread_sleep() instead of possible busy
waiting. Each thread has two new attributes: semaphore and wakeup_time.
When a thread needs to sleep, call sema_down(), and add the thread to
sleep_list. The new timer_interrupt checks the sleep_list every tick by
wakeup_time to see if there are threads that need to be woken up.
If so, use sema_up() to wake them up and then add them to ready_list.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

Every #(TIME_SLICE) ticks, timer_interrupt() will check the sleep_list one by
one if there are threads need wake up. If it is the right time for a thread to
wake up, then timer_interrupt() will sema_up to


---- RATIONALE ----

Advantage: The timer_sleep can guarantee the thread to sleep for the expected
time using semaphore and wakeup-time. The scheduler will not pick the
thread that should be in sleep state. And unlike lock, semaphore can access
by others, so that timer_interrupt can go through the sleep_list and wake
the thread up after it had slept enough time.

Disadvantage: The design is wasteful because each thread need to have
a semaphore. Actually, we think about using one semaphore to implement the
same function, but it will need to sort sleep_list in sleep_time ascending
order in synch.c. This conflicts with priority scheduler.
So we discard this design.


                            PRIORITY SCHEDULER
                            ==================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

None.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

According to the requirements of priority schedule, make these changes.

When a thread is added to the ready_list:
1. create a new thread
2. wake up a sleep thread
3. unblock a thread
4. yield the CPU
Use compare_thread_priority to keep all the threads in ready_list is listing
by decreasing priority.

Create a new method: thread_super_yield to call scheduler whether it is in
interrupt or not so that when a thread is added to the ready list that has a
higher priority than the current running thread, yield the processor
immediately to the new thread.

Change the method thread_ticks to handle the case
1. When the first thread's priority in ready_list is equal to current
thread's: use round_robin.
2. When the first thread's priority in ready_list is less than current
thread's: make the thread_ticks to 0, so the scheduler will check
#(TIME_SLICE) ticks later.

Also, when we use semaphore to block a thread, we make the insertion in the
order of decreasing priority to the list named waiter. We modified sema_up
and cond_wait, then when threads are waiting for semaphore or condition
variable, the highest priority waiting thread will always be woken up first.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

Two synchronization ways:
1. Synchronous  : Every #(TIME_SLICE) ticks, timer_interrupt() will do
                  round-robin between the same priority thread.
2. Asynchronous : Whenever there is a potential higher priority thread added
                 to the ready_list, we will call thread_super_yield() to make
                 sure that the highest priority thread is running.

---- RATIONALE ----

Advantage: Enable priority scheduler that highest priority thread will be
always in running state. If there are several highest priority threads, they
will be scheduled in round-robin strategy. Highest priority thread will be
the first one in most of lists(i.e. ready list, semaphore->waiting list).
At first we compare the priority of the first one in a list with current thread.
If the condition isn't matched, we don't call schedule() at all. With the new
function thread_super_yield(), we can handle in-interrupt and out-interrupt
situations when a new thread comes.

Disadvantage: Not found yet.

                            PRIORITY DONATION
                            =================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

**** thread.h ****
Added to struct thread:
  struct list donation_list;          /* Donation information. */
  int ori_priority;                   /* Original priority before donation. */
  struct lock *wait_lock;             /* The thread is waiting for the lock */
  struct list_elem donation_elem;     /* Element in donation_list. */

---- ALGORITHMS ----

Start:
When thread A is acquiring lock L which is holded by thread B.
Do donation:
  If this is the first time that B is donated, set ori_priority to current
  priority.
  If B also donated to thread C, donate the priority of A to C as well. Repeat
  the nest donation. The maximal depth is 8.
  Push the donation_elem of A to the front of the donation_list of B.
  Set wait_lock of thread A to lock L.
  Block A(push elem of A to lock->sema.waiter).

Then thread B releases the lock L.
Do donation_back:
  Delete all donation_elem if all these threads donated to thread B because of
  lock L.
  Reset wait_lock of thread A.
  Restore priority of thread B to the highest priority in donation_list. If
  there is no donation now, restore to ori_priority.
  Sort the ready_list.
End

If a thread whose priority is donated is going to change priority, check if the
new priority is higher than the current priority. If so, do the change.
Otherwise change the ori_priority instead.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

Do donation and donation_back with interrupt-off.
So race-condition between threads and timer interrupt won't happen.

---- RATIONALE ----

Advantage: Ensure the thread with highest priority will be finished first. Even
if this thread acquires a lock which is already holded by another lower
priority thread.

Disadvantage: No deadlock detection and avoidance.

                            ADVANCED SCHEDULER
                            ==================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

**** thread.h ****
Added to struct thread:
  int nice;                           /* Affect priority for multiple level
                                        feedback queue scheduler. */
  int recent_cpu;                     /* Measure how much CPU time each
                                        process has received "recently". */

**** thread.c ****
Add two static members:
static unsigned calc_ticks;     /* # of timer ticks since last calculate
                                  priority in mlfqs. */

static fixed_point load_avg;    /* System load average, estimate the average
                                  number of threads ready to run over the past
                                  minute. */

**** Add fixed-point.h ****
  typedef int fixed_point;      /* Support fixed-point operation. */


---- ALGORITHMS ----

Recent_cpu is incremented by 1 for the running thread only.

Every 4th clock tick, recalculate priority for every thread.
  priority = PRI_MAX - (recent_cpu / 4) - (nice * 2)
  After recalculating priority, call super_yield()

when timer_ticks() % TIMER_FREQ == 0, update recent_cpu and load_avg.
  recent_cpu = (2*load_avg)/(2*load_avg + 1) * recent_cpu + nice
  load_avg = (59/60)*load_avg + (1/60)*ready_threads

Before schedule operation, sort ready_list first.

In thread_set_nice()
  Set nice( -20 <= nice <= 20),
  Recalculate priority for this thread
  call super_yield()

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

There is a possible race condition between thread_set_nice and interrupt.
But that won't affect the result.

---- RATIONALE ----

Advantage: Reduce the average response time for running jobs.
Disadvantage: Cost some time to recalculate the priority, recent_cpu
              and load_avg.
