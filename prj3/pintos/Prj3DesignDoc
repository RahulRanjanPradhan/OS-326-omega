			PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT

Both frame table and supplemental page table are implemented by hash table.

static struct hash frame_table;
static struct lock frame_table_lock;

struct frame_entry
{
	void *frame;
	struct spt_entry *spte;               /* Supplemental page table entry*/
	struct hash_elem hash_elem;
	struct thread *thread;
};

#define MAX_STACK_SIZE (1 << 25)

enum MEM_TYPE
{
	FILE,
	MMAP,
	SWAP,				//stack or this page has been swap out before.
	HASH_FAIL
};

struct spt_entry		//Supplemental page table entry
{
	enum MEM_TYPE type;	//MMAP FILE SWAP
	bool in_memory;
	bool writable;
	void *vaddr;
  bool locked;

  // Fields for file
  struct file *file;
  size_t offset;
  size_t read_bytes;
  size_t zero_bytes;
  
  // Fields for swap
  size_t swap_index;
	
  struct hash_elem elem;
};

struct thread
	struct hash spt;										/* Supppplemental page table. */

---- ALGORITHMS ----

------
>> A2: In a few paragraphs, describe your code for locating the frame,
>> if any, that contains the data of a given page.

Allocate a free frame
	a. If there is a free frame in frame table: palloc_get_page == true
	Otherwise, evict a frame which will be talked about in the next part.
			
	b. Add that frame to frame table:	
			insert a frame_entry to frame table(hash table)

	c. Return the frame.

Using a supppplemental page table (hash table) per thread
	Record the mapping from a page to file(executable) or MMAP
	Record the mapping from a page to swap

------
>> A3: How does your code coordinate accessed and dirty bits between
>> kernel and user virtual addresses that alias a single frame, or
>> alternatively how do you avoid the issue?

Get accessed and dirty bits if I already have hash_elem in a frame_entry.
	In my struct frame_entry, I can access the supppplemental page table and the
	thread which the frame is allocated to.
	Use 
	pagedir_is_accessed(t->pagedir, fte->spte->vaddr)
	pagedir_is_dirty(t->pagedir, fte->spte->vaddr)
	to get accessed and dirty bits.


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

------

There is a frame_table_lock to avoid these races.

Hash table saves space and time to access data.


		       PAGING TO AND FROM DISK
		       =======================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

------
>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

// PGSIZE = 4KB; BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE = 512B
#define SECTORS_PER_PAGE (PGSIZE / BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE)

struct lock swap_lock;

struct block *swap_block;

struct bitmap *swap_bitmap;


---- ALGORITHMS ----

------
>> B2: When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe your code for choosing a frame to evict.

void* frame_evict (enum palloc_flags flags); 

Second chance algorithm:

1. Get a hash_iterator of the global frame table.
2. Iterate in the frame table
3. Get the attributes of the supplemental page table to the frame_entry.
4. If the frame is not locked
		If accessed: set accessed to false
		Else: 			 If (is dirty) write to file or swap_out according to type
								 Free the frame


------
B3: When a process P obtains a frame that was previously used by a
>> process Q, how do you adjust the page table (and any other data
>> structures) to reflect the frame Q no longer has?
Write Q's contents to swap space, and change page and frame tables to indicate 
frame Q no longer in memory.

The frame entry records the thread which has the access to the frame.

------
>> B4: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an
>> invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended into
>> the page that faulted.

1. The invalid virtual address must be user address.
USER_VADDR_BOTTOM <= vaddr <= PHYS_BASE

2. Can't find the supplemental page table to that vaddr.

3. The virtual address must be in stack segment.
	fault_addr >= f->esp - 32

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B5: Explain the basics of your VM synchronization design.  In
>> particular, explain how it prevents deadlock.  (Refer to the
>> textbook for an explanation of the necessary conditions for
>> deadlock.)
Deadlock needs four necessary conditions:
Mutual exculsion : use sharable resources like read only files
Hold and wait
No preemption
Circular wait

------
>> B6: A page fault in process P can cause another process Q's frame
>> to be evicted.  How do you ensure that Q cannot access or modify
>> the page during the eviction process?  How do you avoid a race
>> between P evicting Q's frame and Q faulting the page back in?

Use a locked attribute in supplemental page table entry to avoid this 
situation. Don't allow evict a locked frame.
P cause a frame of Q to be evicted. If Q want to access the frame,
do page fault to swap_in the frame. And set the spt_entry->locked to true.


------

>> the file system or swap.  How do you ensure that a second process Q

Use a locked attribute in supplemental page table entry to avoid this 
situation. Don't allow evict a locked frame.
If the frame is being read in, set the spt_entry->locked to true.


------
>> B8: Explain how you handle access to paged-out pages that occur
>> during system calls.  Do you use page faults to bring in pages (as
>> in user programs), or do you have a mechanism for "locking" frames

First of all, the virtual address must be used by user.
In page fault, if the page of vaddr is not present and can be find in spte.
Load this page either from a file or a swap.

Three conditions I want to lock frames into physical memory.
1. Loading the page
2. Removing mmap
3. Adding a page by grow_stack


---- RATIONALE ----

------
>> B9: A single lock for the whole VM system would make

Use a single lock for the whole VM system(frame_table_lock).
Because it's easy to design and less possible to get a deadlock.

			 MEMORY MAPPED FILES
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

------
>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

Thread.h
Add

struct thread
	struct list mmaps;							    /* List of memory mapped files. */
  int mapid;													/* Mapped file id. */


struct mmap_file {
  struct spt_entry *spte;
  int mapid;
  struct list_elem elem;
};

---- ALGORITHMS ----

------
>> C2: Describe how memory mapped files integrate into your virtual
>> memory subsystem.  Explain how the page fault and eviction
>> processes differ between swap pages and other pages.

1. Get the file.
2. read_bytes = file_length(file)
3. while(read_bytes > 0)
{
	add mmap_page to thread->spt and thread->mmaps
	read_bytes -= page_read_bytes;
}
		
In page fault, swap pages should be loaded from swap. File pages and mmap pages
should be loaded from files.
In eviction, swap pages should be swap_out and modified file and mmap pages 
should be saved in files.

Not implemented yet.

I share loading code for these two.
	case FILE:
  case MMAP:
    success = load_file(spte);

But the evicting processes for these two types are different. So I
need two types.
